				<h3>Drag Crush is Better Than Other Drag Race Fantasy Leagues</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>It's spoiler proof!</strong> You don't see any scores or statistics for episodes that you have not indicated that you've seen. This includes your own scores and scores for other participants, as well as contestant scores.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>It's more creative!</strong> The rules are more fun, and are tailored to the different types of Drag Races.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>It's flexible!</strong> With multiple ways to play, there's something for everyone - whether you are deeply competitive and want to compete directly against other Drag Race fans, fantasy league-style, or you just enjoy playing along with the season using the weekly draft. Or both!
					</li>
				</ol>

			<h3>Two Ways to Play</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>On your own</strong> - Draft a fantasy team of queens from each upcoming episode of an onging Drag Race and accumulate points for your drafted queens. You can track how your team ranks against all other participants.</li>
				<li><strong>On a panel</strong> - Create a private panel of up to 20 participants with friends or join a public panel. Hop online at your panel's scheduled draft time to draft your fantasy Drag Race team. Panels have the additional option of drafting Wildqueens - queens from the master list of all RPDR contestants who might show up in a season and score you additional points.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Worried about spoilers?</h3>
			<p>Don't be! You won't see any scores until you choose to Ruveal them yourself.

			<h3>How does scoring work?</h3>
			<p>Your esteemed admin user, kittygirl, watches each episode and sets the scores based on predetermined rules. For older seasons, kittygirl is getting there and sometimes using wikipedia, with the goal of scoring all RPDR contestants for <i>statistics</i>. Why? Everyone loves statistics!</p>
			<p>Rules vary by what type of Drag Race it is:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><a href="{% url 'dragrace_rules' drag_race_type='standard' %}">Standard Drag Race</a></li>
				<li><a href="{% url 'dragrace_rules' drag_race_type='all star' %}">Drag Race All Stars</a></li>
				<li><a href="{% url 'dragrace_rules' drag_race_type='international' %}">International Drag Race</a></li>
			</ol>
