<p>Always wanted to be a part of RuPaul's Drag Race, 
	but lack the charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent to get there? Well, now's your chance! Join Drag Crush to play along with current seasons, fantasy league style!
</p>
<h2>Two Ways to Play</h2>
<ol>
	<li><strong>On your own</strong> - Draft a fantasy team of queens from each upcoming episode of an onging Drag Race and accumulate points for your drafted queens. You can track how your team ranks against all other participants.</li>
	<li><strong>On a panel</strong> - Create a private panel of up to 20 participants with friends or join a public panel. Hop online at your panel's scheduled draft time to draft your fantasy Drag Race team. Panels have the additional option of drafting Wildqueens - queens from the master list of all RPDR contestants who might show up in a season and score you additional points.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Worried about spoilers?</h2>
<p>Don't be! You won't see episode scores until you choose to Ruveal them yourself. All links to pages with potential spoilers are marked by a &#9889;.

<h2>How does scoring work?</h2>
<p>Your esteemed admin user, kittygirl, watches each episode and sets the scores based on predetermined rules. For older seasons, kittygirl is getting there and sometimes using wikipedia, with the goal of scoring all RPDR contestants for <i>statistics</i>. Why? Everyone loves statistics!</p>
<p>Rules vary by what type of Drag Race it is:</p>
